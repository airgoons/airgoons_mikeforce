Dev Environment
===============

Dependencies
------------
1.  Git (configuration not in scope of this document)
2.  Visual Studio 2019 or later (configuration not in scope of this document)

Setup
-----
1.  Adjust configuration.json to support test usage
        Arma3Tools_Path - retain normal setting
        MikeForce_Path - retain normal setting
        Customizations_Path - set to full path of customation directory location in the local git repository
        Output_Path - set as desired
        Output_Filename - retain normal setting
        Cleanup - set false
        Working_Path - set to the full path that corresponds to "%USERPROFILE%/Documents/Arma 3/mpmissions", e.g. C:/Users/wonkotron/[...]
2.  Open Arma 3 and launch Eden editor
3.  Verify that the mission is available to be selected and loaded

Workflow
--------
0.  Build mission_pack_unpack and customize configuration.json per the Setup section above
1.  Create a new Git branch for your new feature
        a)  Open a Terminal at the git repository directory
        b)  Execute:
                git checkout -b new_feature_name
                git push -u origin new_feature_name
2.  Make any desired changes to mission configuration text files in the git repository
3.  Execute mission_pack_unpack.exe
4.  Load the mission in Eden
5.  VERIFY that mission loads without error messages
        a) Failure at this step requries troubleshooting before proceeding, return to step 2
6.  Commit changes to GitHub (normal Git workflow is out of scope for this document, see https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/, https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
7.  Make any changes to the mission's units and objects in Eden
8.  Test the mission locally
9.  Copy mission.sqm from the mission directory in mpmissions to the corresponding location in the local git repository
10.  Commit changes to the local git repository
11.  Push new commits to GitHub
12.  Repeat from step 2 until all changes for the feature are complete and tested
13.  In GitHub, initiate a pull request to merge your feature branch into main
14.  Sufficiently test the feature change
15.  Commit the merge as "Squash and Merge" to main
